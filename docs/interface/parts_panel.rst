In Dust3D, model consists of parts, part consists of nodes. User manipulates nodes's position and radius, toggle part's settings, then the mesh autogenerated by Dust3D.

Top Mini Buttons
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
(From left to right)

* Visible/(H)idden

Toggle the part's visibility on canvas, the mesh generation would not be affected. You can use it to hide some parts, then make edit other parts not been covered.

* (J)oin/Not Join(to Final Mesh)

Toggle the part's enablility, affects the final mesh generation. Unjoined parts would not appear in the result.

* (L)ock/Unlock

Toggle the part's edit lock. Locked part would still be visible on canvas, but can not been checked or edited.

* Color Picker

Choose the part's color. If there isn't color choosen, the Rendered Model will be show as the default color.
The color choosen here will exported as a material color in the result output.

Rendered Part Preview
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Shows the rendered image of the whole part's generated mesh.

Bottom Mini Buttons
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* (B)ox/Subdivisioned Box

Toggle the basic unit type of mesh generation. Box means quad face, subdivisioned box means octagon face. If you want more sharp edges, choose box, otherwise choose subdivisioned box to make edges smooth.

* Thickness Modifier

This is used when you want make fish body like mesh, or a thin or thick plane.
The are two parameters for this modifier, one controls the thickness along the base plane normal, the other controls the thickness along the perpendicular of base plane normal.

* (M)irror Modifier

If there are two parts have the same shape but one sit left, the other sit right. It's like the human body, you no need to make the arm part two times, just once, and mirror it.

* End Ro(U)ndable Modifier

Toggle the begin/end roundable (Flat / Rounded). If you want the cut effect, choose not rounded, otherwise, the edge end will be rounded (Automatically added one more small face).

Context Menu
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Right click on Parts List Panel to trigger Context Menu.

* Hide Part / Show Part / Hide Other Parts / Show All Parts / Hide All Parts

Check mini button **Visible/(H)idden**.

* Lock All Parts / Unlock All Parts

Check mini button **_(L)ock/Unlock**.

* Invert Part / Cancel Inverse

Inverting a part means subtract this part from other parts which sit before this part.

* Move Up / Move Down / Move To Top / Move To Bottom

The process of mesh generation is mainly combining all the parts in listed order, so move up and down may affect the generated result. The order is especially important for inverse part been placed, if the inverse part sit in the first place of the list, the inverse operation would never happen, because nothing to invert before it.
